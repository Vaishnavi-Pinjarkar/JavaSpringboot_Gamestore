# JavaSpringboot_Gamestore
GameStore is a Java Spring Boot application meticulously crafted for managing a game store's inventory and customer information. Leveraging the power of Spring Boot, it provides a streamlined platform for performing CRUD operations efficiently. The backend relies on a MySQL database managed through XAMPP, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

With GameStore, users can seamlessly perform a range of operations including user authentication with login and registration functionalities. Once authenticated, users can add, update, view, and delete game products and manage customer information. Whether it's adding new games to the inventory, updating existing entries, or removing outdated products, GameStore offers intuitive functionality for managing the store's database.

GameStore's user-friendly interface, comprehensive backend functionality, and integrated authentication make it the perfect solution for game store management, empowering users to maintain an organized and up-to-date inventory effortlessly.
